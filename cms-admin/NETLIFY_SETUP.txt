Netlify CMS (Decap) setup guide for cms-admin (no front-end changes)

Prerequisites:
- Netlify account (free)
- This repository hosted on GitHub (recommended)

Steps:
1) Deploy cms-admin as a separate site
   - In Netlify, click "Add new site" -> "Import an existing project"
   - Select this repository and choose base directory: cms-admin
   - Build command: none (static)
   - Publish directory: cms-admin
   - Deploy site

2) Enable Netlify Identity (for CMS login)
   - Go to Site Settings -> Identity -> Enable Identity
   - In Identity -> Settings:
     - Registration: Open or Invite Only (your choice)
     - External providers: optional

3) Enable Git Gateway
   - In Identity -> Services -> Enable Git Gateway
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repository

4) Configure CMS backend
   - In cms-admin/config.yml, ensure:

     backend:
       name: git-gateway
       branch: main

   - If your default branch is not main, change it accordingly.

5) Media and public paths
   The config uses:
     media_folder: "content/media"
     public_folder: "/content/media"
   This will store uploaded media in your repository under content/media.

6) Login to CMS
   - Visit your site URL: https://<yoursite>.netlify.app
   - Append /admin/ or open index.html directly:
     https://<yoursite>.netlify.app/index.html
   - Click "Login" (Netlify Identity)

7) Workflow
   - Edits in CMS create/modify files under content/ folders in your repo via Git Gateway.
   - On push to main, the GitHub Action .github/workflows/content-sync.yml runs and regenerates project-hub-x/src/data/mockData.ts.
   - Your app deployment (e.g., Render) can be configured to redeploy on push to main.

8) Optional: Lock CMS to admins
   - In Netlify Identity, invite specific users and set Registration to Invite Only.

That’s it! Your CMS edits are versioned in Git and automatically synced to your app data without changing front-end code.
