## ✨ What's Been Done

### ✅ Removed (All Wix Dependencies)
- ❌ All 40+ `@wix/*` packages
- ❌ Wix CLI commands
- ❌ Wix authentication system
- ❌ Wix Data collections
- ❌ Wix image optimization
- ❌ Wix SEO components
- ❌ Wix monitoring tools
- ❌ `wix.config.json`

### ✅ Added (Local Alternatives)
- ✅ Mock CMS system (in-memory data)
- ✅ Mock authentication (localStorage-based)
- ✅ Standard image handling
- ✅ Astro Node adapter for SSR
- ✅ Sample data for testing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### ✅ Preserved (Everything Else)
- ✅ All UI components (Radix UI)
- ✅ All styling (Tailwind CSS)
- ✅ All business logic
- ✅ All page components
- ✅ All routes and navigation
- ✅ All forms and interactions
- ✅ Responsive design

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Local Development
- Runs on **localhost:3000**
- No external dependencies
- No Wix account needed
- No internet connection required (after npm install)

### Mock Data System
- In-memory data storage
- CRUD operations supported
- Sample data available
- Easy to initialize

### Mock Authentication
- Simple login/logout
- Session persistence
- No real validation (dev only)
- Easy to test

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### This is a Development Setup
- **Data is temporary** - Resets on server restart
- **Auth is mocked** - Not secure for production
- **No backend** - All processing client-side

### For Production
You'll need to add:
1. Real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
2. Real authentication (Auth0, Supabase, etc.)
3. Backend API routes
4. Environment variables
5. Image optimization
6. Deployment configuration

---

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### 1. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Check Browser
Open `http://localhost:3000` and verify:
- ✅ Page loads
- ✅ Styling is correct
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Navigation works

### 3. Test Authentication
- Click "Sign In"
- Enter any email
- Verify login works
- Test logout

### 4. Verify Build
```bash
npm run build
```
Should complete without errors.
