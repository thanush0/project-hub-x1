Title: feat(functions): add multi-provider email service and wire up contact/custom request handlers

Summary
- Introduces provider-agnostic email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP via Nodemailer) with development-mode logging fallback.
- Updates Netlify functions:
  - contact-form.ts: validation, admin notification
  - custom-request.ts: requestId, admin notification, client confirmation, optional SAVE_REQUESTS_TO_GIT
- Adds environment variable documentation and complete guide (EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md)
- Adds test tooling for local and deployed verification

Changes
- netlify/functions/services/email-service.ts (new)
- netlify/functions/contact-form.ts (updated)
- netlify/functions/custom-request.ts (updated)
- project-hub-x/.env.example (updated)
- README.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, DEPLOYMENT_READY.md, PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md (updated)
- tools/test-email-functions.mjs (new)
- tools/test-email-service-local.mjs (new)
- package.json at repo root: add nodemailer dep for SMTP

How to test
1) Local (development mode)
- Ensure ADMIN_EMAIL and FROM_EMAIL are set
- Run: netlify dev --port 8888
- In another terminal: node tools/test-email-functions.mjs http://localhost:8888
- Expect: 200 responses; function logs show "Email would be sent (no provider configured)"

2) Deployed
- Set env vars in Netlify according to EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Run: node tools/test-email-functions.mjs https://<your-site>.netlify.app
- Expect: 200 responses; actual emails delivered if provider configured

Configuration
- EMAIL_PROVIDER: sendgrid | mailgun | smtp | (empty = development)
- SendGrid: SENDGRID_API_KEY
- Mailgun: MAILGUN_API_KEY, MAILGUN_DOMAIN
- SMTP: SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_SECURE, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASSWORD
- ADMIN_EMAIL, FROM_EMAIL
- Optional: SAVE_REQUESTS_TO_GIT=true

Notes
- No breaking changes; functions gracefully degrade when email not configured
- SMTP requires nodemailer (provided via root package.json)

Checklist
- [x] Functions compile and run locally
- [x] Docs updated with EMAIL_SETUP_GUIDE.md and pointers
- [x] Env example updated
- [x] Tests added (tools)
